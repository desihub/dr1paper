# DESI Data Release 1 

## Zenodo Data

Data files associated with the figures in DESI Collaboration et al
(2025, AJ, submitted, arXiv:2503.14745), "Data Release 1 of the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument".

The figures in this paper were generated using code and notebooks in
https://github.com/desihub/dr1paper. For convenience and for all but
the first two figures in the paper (see below), we also provide the
processed data points used to generate these figures.
